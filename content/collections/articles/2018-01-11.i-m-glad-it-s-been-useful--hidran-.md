I’m glad it’s been useful, Hidran.

Thanks for your note. I haven’t checked lately so this may have changed, but I think the base method in the trait is called `getLogin`. We need to alias that to something else so we can override and reuse it.

I simply picked `login` as an alternative, but you can choose any method name that would be unique to your Controller class.

I hope that makes sense.
