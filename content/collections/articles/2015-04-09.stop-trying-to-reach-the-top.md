Read [this](http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/googles-panda-algorithm-creating-endangered-species/). Were you hit by Google Panda? Will you be hit when they start [penalising non-mobile sites](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html)?

The lesson? Stop *trying* to reach the top of Google. You’ll live longer/keep more of your natural hair/knit more jumpers/grow more hay etc etc.

Also: stop demanding that Google keep being as generous as they have been! You sound spoiled. You brat.

Stop relying on one popular brand/service. Ever heard of keeping all your eggs in one basket. Unless you want broken eggs… I’m sure scrambled-off-the-floor has a unique, perhaps even Heston-esque, taste to it.

But if you prefer dirt-free, poached perfection, drizzled with warm Hollandaise, get a couple more baskets.

Trust me, it goes much better with smoked salmon.
