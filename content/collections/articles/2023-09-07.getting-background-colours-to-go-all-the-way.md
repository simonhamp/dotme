I'm pretty proud of the [Gitamic](https://gitamic.simonhamp.me) diff viewer. It's not perfect (and probably never will be thanks to different rendering engines), but it can handle some pretty gnarly diffs quite rapidly.

Of course, a lot of this is down to browsers rendering engines getting faster and faster.

But it still took me a while to make it as quick as it is. Hint: don't use tables.

One thing that I fixed the other day that I want to talk about now is the 

In HTML, when a container that has a background colour is inside another container that has a fixed width, the background colour can get clipped.

<!-- Demo of lines missing background colours -->

That's a little unsightly, but not a show-stopper.

The other problem this causes tho is that any sticky elements, such as the line number bar, which is a `sticky` element, gets cut off at that same point.

<!-- Demo of the sticky numbers bar getting clipped/shunted -->

Why?

Because the calculated width of those inner containers is reduce to the minimum it can be to hold their contents.

In order to force the background to stretch, we have to apply a `min-width` to all of the inner containers.

We could hard-code a very wide fixed width to these to try to account for really long lines... but I bet there will always be some new case that goes just a little further.

Besides, we've got these super powerful calculators rendering these views - it should be able to work out what the widest line is and make all of them the same width.... right?

But how do we know what that width should be?

We could cycle through each element and find the longest one, but there are problems with that: if we have a lot of elements, it's going to be a bit slower. If the elements aren't always there, timing is going to be an issue as we won't get the widths

But let's say our timing issues are all solved and we can put up with a few extra milliseconds on the render time, how do we even get the full width of the inner container? `getClientWidth` and `getClientBoundingRects().width` will only give us the _visible_ width, not the full width.

What we actually need is the `scrollWidth` of the parent - the container that has created this problem in the first place also has the solution!

`scrollWidth` is what the browser uses to determine how far the scrollbar needs to travel and how big the scrollbar handle needs to be. But we can also use it to determine the maximum width of all of the contained elements.

Awesome! That means there's no loop over the
