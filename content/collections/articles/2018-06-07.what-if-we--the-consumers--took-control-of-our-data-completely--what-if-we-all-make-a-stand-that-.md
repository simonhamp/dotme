What if we, the consumers, took control of our data completely… what if we all make a stand that forced big tech (and others eventually) to *come to us* for our data instead of just handing it to them on a plate?

If we could do that, then we’d stand to benefit the most from it, stepping up with our biggest bargaining chip **in hand**, instead of sacrificing our place at the table for free.

I would love to see companies *paying me* for my data directly, instead of paying Facebook or Google.

I know there are many parts to this and it would take a while to work as it’s quite idealistic, but it starts by making a stand.
