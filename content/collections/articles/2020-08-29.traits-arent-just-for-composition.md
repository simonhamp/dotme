I'm going to disagree with myself later on this, but I think for the sake of this article it's not too much to say: _Traits are possibly one of the greatest things to be added to PHP in recent times_.

They've made a huge difference to the way we build software in PHP. Instead of trying to inherit all of the correct functionality from ever-more-abstract base classes, we can now compose classes out of discrete chunks of code.

This makes for clean inheritance trees and code that can be reasoned about more easily. But when should you use a Trait and when should you not? What are Traits really good for?

## Traitor

```php
<?php

class 
```
