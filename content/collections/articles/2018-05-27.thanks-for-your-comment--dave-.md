Thanks for your comment, Dave.

So I’ve seen this tackled a few ways. For us we wanted the assurance that it was working as it would in production. So we’re using Composer all the way.

One trick I’ve found useful when working locally (so I don’t have to keep running `composer update`) is to add the namespace reference for your package to your root project’s autoload manifest in its composer.json. There’s also [this approach](https://laravel-news.com/developing-laravel-packages-with-local-composer-dependencies) which I’m yet to try.
