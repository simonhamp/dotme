Thanks for this, Will. I was looking for something like this the other day and this is an ideal solution for now.

I’m currently working on making it play nicely with Laravel Echo too: <https://github.com/simonhamp/echo/tree/ratchet-connector>

This requires some standardisation in the message format being sent through Ratchet, but hopefully my RatchetServer class implementation will be able to port easily over to your package and others can use it then too :)
