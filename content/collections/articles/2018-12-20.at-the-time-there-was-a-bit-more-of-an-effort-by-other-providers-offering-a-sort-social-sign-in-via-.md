At the time there was a bit more of an effort by other providers offering a sort social sign-in via OAuth services, but to my knowledge they’ve all but disappeared.

Google has been one of the most prominent since. Their service is a bit more complex than OAuth 2, as I understand it, but there’s still some fear around Google and there are people who have sworn off using their services altogether because of problems with the amount and type of data they’re gathering as well as their monopolistic and pervasive technology.
