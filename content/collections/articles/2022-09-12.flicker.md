### Flicker

Just a little flicker

That’s all it takes

A thick piece made thinner

Until it’s all erased

\[Chorus\]

Can’t get close to touch

Intense – it’s just too much

Life is drawn out and up

And away, away, away

A tiny flicker

That’s how it starts

Now my heart’s beating quicker

It tears our lives apart

\[Chorus\]

Here comes the last flicker

It’s time to go

Remember

When time goes slow
