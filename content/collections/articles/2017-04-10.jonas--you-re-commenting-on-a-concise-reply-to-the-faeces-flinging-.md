Jonas, you’re commenting on a concise *reply* to the faeces-flinging. In no way does this belittle: Taylor didn’t have to snapshot those other frameworks in there. At worst it says “well if Symfony is used on big projects, then seeing as Laravel is generally more popular, it stands a decent chance of being used on some big projects too”.

And who better to stand up for the project that’s being besmirched than the creator of it?

I really feel like this could’ve been done a lot worse!
