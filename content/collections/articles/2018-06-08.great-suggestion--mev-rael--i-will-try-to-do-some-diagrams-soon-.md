Great suggestion, Mev-Rael. I will try to do some diagrams soon.

As for Swoole, I have heard about it. I’m a little confused by the fractious branding and messaging around it at the moment. It would be nice to see some focus — it feels like it’s trying to hit too many big targets and it’s sort of missing all of them. And some folks are trying a bit too hard to sell it. But I’m happy watching from the sidelines to see how it develops.

My concern with it is that adoption is going to be quite tough given that it’s a C-level module that needs to be compiled in. I think once the teething problems have been sorted out and it’s stable and secure for the majority use-cases, if the performance gains are provably better, it will eventually make its way into PHP core.
