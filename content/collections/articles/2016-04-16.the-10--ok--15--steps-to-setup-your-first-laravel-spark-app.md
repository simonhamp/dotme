### The 10 (ok, 15) steps to setup your first Laravel Spark app

#### a.k.a. “The long way”

***Edit: Since writing this,*** [***Laravel Valet***](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet) ***has been launched. I haven’t tried it yet, but if you use a Mac it looks like an excellent foundation for your development environment and ideal for setting up Spark installs (***[***among many others***](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/valet#introduction)***) without the overhead of Homestead and looks way easier to use than Apple’s built-in AMP setup or MAMP. Nice work*** [***Taylor Otwell***](https://medium.com/u/d694c31ce941) ***and*** [***Adam Wathan***](https://medium.com/u/2bdb4734b294)***.***

I wanted to try Spark, but [I’m not ready for Homestead](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/4f2xkf/the_10_steps_to_setup_your_first_laravel_spark_app/d25mzlq). To be honest that would be the better way to go all round as it’s pre-packaged with everything you need.

But that doesn’t work for everyone and I wanted to get it running without changing my setup. I also wanted to use the Spark installer not just the download method.

I found the [current docs](https://spark.laravel.com/docs/1.0/installation) fall a little short on this at the moment. I’m sure they’ll be updated. But I just jumped straight into the install and hit a few errors along the way.

Here are some of the hurdles I experienced on my install journey:

> **Class Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts is not autoloadable, can not call post-installcmd script**

And:

> **gulp not installed**

And some Browserify error at the end. Which all basically come down to either missing or outdated components. So here’s an install run list for you to follow which \*should\* get you there in no time. Hopefully it will save you a few minutes.

(I’m running MAMP with PHP 7, but there’s no reasons why this process shouldn’t apply in most other working setups.)

1. The docs say under ‘Requirements’: Composer, Laravel 5.2, Laravel Elixir and Bootstrap LESS. If you use the Spark installer though, all you really need to do is [set up Elixir](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/elixir#installation). Here’s an adapted version:
2. Make sure you install/update to the [latest stable version of node.js](https://nodejs.org/). I’m running the 4.x branch.
3. Make npm a global package so you can update that separately to node:  
    **sudo npm install npm -g (**as per [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node))
4. [Install gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md):  
    **sudo npm install -g gulp-cli** (this command will suffice)
5. You may need to run this command to grab some extra Elixir dependencies:  
    **npm install babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react  
    OR**  As [Nate Ritter](https://medium.com/u/2f12b13c433) has suggested, install this globally (thanks Nate):  
    **npm install -g babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react**
6. Update composer (obvs you’ve got composer installed):  
    **composer self-update**
7. Install/update the Laravel installer:  
    **composer global \[require/update\] “laravel/installer”**
8. [Get Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/) (you need to register, login, add a payment method, buy a licence and, if you want to use the Spark installer, generate an API token)
9. [Set up the Spark installer](https://spark.laravel.com/docs/1.0/installation#spark-installer) — this is a multi-step process all of its own that’s not well covered in the docs yet if you’re not used to working with GitHub etc. I will cover this soon.
10. Run the Spark install where you want your project to live:  
    **spark new \[your-spark-project\]**
11. Create a new database for your app
12. Set up a virtual host and point the site root at the **/path/to/project/\[your-spark-project\]/public** and create an appropriate hosts file entry for it
13. Spark installs expecting to be inside Homestead, so the .env is configured for that. You’ll need to change the **APP\_URL**, **DB\_DATABASE**, **DB\_USERNAME** and **DB\_PASSWORD** settings according to your setup
14. Run the Laravel database migrations. In your app’s root:  
    **php artisan migrate**
15. Load up your new dev vhost domain in the browser and you should see this:

Hello, Spark

All done. [Go play!](https://spark.laravel.com/docs/1.0/quickstart) (and [watch the Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-spark/))

Hat tip to the awesome folks in the [Laravel Slack team](https://larachat.co/) (particularly **coderleo** and **tommytompkins**)

You may experience the missing Elixir dependencies in Homestead. [Check out this discussion on Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/spark/spark-or-elixir-issue).
