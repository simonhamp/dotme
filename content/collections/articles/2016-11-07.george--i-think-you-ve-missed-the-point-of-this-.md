George, I think you’ve missed the point of this. Clearly, the aim is to not *store passwords anywhere*.

So the only place a password will be stored is on a third-party’s server(s). And then this password will be strong and unique across your set of passwords.

Also, with the right tooling, you won’t need to remember the password because LessPass can regenerate it for you given that all elements that make up that password are the same.

So technically there’s no such thing as “changing” your master password… there’s no hard reference to it at all, so it can be whatever you want, whenever you want except that if you choose to use a new master password before generating (and updating) third-party site passwords using that new master key, you will essentially ‘lock yourself out’ (although that’s not strictly the case).

There is some trade-off for the advantages.

I understand your point about leaking the master password, but there are still some key bits there that could be done to help defend against improper use in case someone did manage to guess/find your master key.

Two-factor authentication, for example— presumably this wouldn’t be so tricky to implement and tie to your profile for when you “login” to LessPass.
