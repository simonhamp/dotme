All stay-ups were once start-ups, even Basecamp nee 37 Signals. Most required some outside funding (savings, loans, grants or gifts) that didn’t come directly from revenue at the beginning. The only technical difference is time.

But in the spirit of what’s being said here, I absolutely agree with Jason because the term ‘start-up’ has morphed into an almost ugly word (in some circles) for ‘corporate sell-out’, or ‘over-hyped, over-valued, spongey unicorn-wannabes’.

However, just because you’re ‘technically’ a funded startup doesn’t mean you don’t have the right attitude, experience and world-view to go the distance.

Let’s keep things balanced and in perspective.
