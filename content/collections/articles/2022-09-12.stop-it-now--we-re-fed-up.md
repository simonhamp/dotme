### Stop it now. We’re fed up

Generally speaking, people in the Western/Developed world are getting fed up of advertising, marketing and profiteering.

\[get sources!!!\]

While all the marketing blogs are desperately trying to attract more and more ‘pageviews’ by writing articles like “Top 10 Ways to Growth Hack Your Startup”, the actual end-users who will be the targets of these so-called growth-hacking techniques are even more quickly becoming desensitised to them.

Marketing used to be a wonderful industry. Clearly it worked. It went from a “Holy crap, that poster made such a difference to our bottom line”, to a whole artform, to now just a machine that can be fueled by money and switched on and off at will, heavily analysed and overly invasive to individual’s privacy.

And it’s getting tiresome. It’s not just boring and tiring for the modern marketer to do, but as marketers churn out the same rubbish as each other in vain hope that their version of \[rubbish\] attracts a segment of the market’s attention — adjusted for relevant demographics and cohorts — the audience is actually getting bored.

Saturation

\[how do we know this?\]

Why?

Overzealous marketing.  
Too much openness on succes. Intentionallu or not  
Copycats
