Over the past few months, we’ve been doing something similar in PHP. It’s been a really interesting approach that has almost completely changed the way I think about building every project I work on.

I may take a leaf out of your book and find ways to share what we’ve been doing because I think it’s a workable, pragmatic approach.

And that’s just for a team of 2!
