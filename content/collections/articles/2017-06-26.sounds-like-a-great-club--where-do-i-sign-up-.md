Sounds like a great club, where do I sign up?

I’ve been writing PHP for the better part of 12 years and I’ve not once felt the need to be part of this. I know plenty of great developers who do what they need to get the job done, put food on the table and go spend time with their friends and loved ones.

You’ve already gone well beyond that. You should be very proud of what you’ve achieved and what you’ve added to the real PHP community.

I’m sure I’m not the only one to say thank you.

Just be careful not to adopt that same mentality as your own community grows around you. Giving others the time and opportunity to shine will help Laravel to continue to stand out and keep moving forward.
