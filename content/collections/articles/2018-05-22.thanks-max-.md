Thanks Max.

I will read more about this later, but from the repo’s readme it looks like this is more about how you can address input in an object-oriented manner and less about how you transform input.

Please let me know if I’ve missed something here. I’m sure this library could be made to support that with some adaptation, but it looks like it only covers part of what I’m talking about.
