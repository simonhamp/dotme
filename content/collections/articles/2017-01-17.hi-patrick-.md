Hi Patrick,

Thanks for the update. Like many others, I’m really looking forward to see progress on Spirit. I believe it could be a great alternative.

If things are close, maybe it’s worth sharing some short videos demonstrating some of the functionality? It would be cool to see even just some glimpses of your progress :)

Also, you mentioned that many people have offered to help and I’m sure many more would like to… how do we go about doing that?
