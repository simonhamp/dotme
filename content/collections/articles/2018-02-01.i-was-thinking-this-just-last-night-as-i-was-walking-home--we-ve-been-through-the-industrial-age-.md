I was thinking this just last night as I was walking home: we’ve been through the Industrial Age, the Information Age and we’re in the middle (on the way out?) of the Personalisation Age (aka the Data Age) and the next logical step feels like the Privacy Age.

Caveat: I have yet to read the entire article but I’m looking forward to doing so!

Thanks for sharing, Langridge!
