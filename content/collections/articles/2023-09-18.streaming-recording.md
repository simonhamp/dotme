I started streaming on Twitch a while ago. My plan was to do it regularly, but you know how life gets in the way.

I'm going to make a concerted effort to do more tho going forwards. Streams are going to be focused on my side projects and open source work

[I stream on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/simonhamp) currently (though I might move fully to YouTube as Twitch is a bit too gaming-focused) and I [keep recordings organised on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/simonhamp)

Follow me on whichever you prefer
