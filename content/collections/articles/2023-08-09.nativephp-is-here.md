You already know this. Unless you've been under a magically floating rock for a couple of weeks.

Please go check it out: [nativephp.com](https://nativephp.com)

I'm still working on the Tauri driver, but [Marcel](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot) did an awesome job getting the Electron version done and dusted in time for Laracon US. You should watch his talk!

And if you build something or write about it or make a video, please share it on [awesome-nativephp](https://github.com/nativephp/awesome-nativephp) - I love seeing what everyone is doing with it ðŸ˜Š
