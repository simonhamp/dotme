I’ve spent a lot of time training as a teacher and teaching others and I think this is a fantastic example of a mantra I learned early on in my training: **TNT**: Teach, Not Tell

But like all communications, it goes both ways. Although this isn’t a meandering tome by any means, you’ve still also had to be a patient learner, accepting and appreciating the time invested in improving your understanding by someone who has more experience.

So, well done for being a good learner!
