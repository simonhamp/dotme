Thanks for that note, Andy. I’ve updated the article with some notes to that effect.

I’ve just had a look myself and it seems that the underlying method name got changed to `login` around Laravel 5.3, so for anything newer than that, you’ll need to alias `login as someOtherName;` in order to override it.

Glad this is still proving useful 2 years later though! :)
