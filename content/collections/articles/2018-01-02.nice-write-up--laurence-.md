Nice write up, Laurence! I’m keen to hear more about the cases where you’re reaching for Laravel. Can you give some solid examples?

I also took a look at your Laramen project some time ago. It sounds interesting in theory, but I came to a similar conclusion that that’s probably not the right approach.

We went ‘all in’ on Lumen, as it were, and I’ve been writing an API in it for the past couple of months. I have to say I’ve really enjoyed it and honestly I haven’t yet found anything from Laravel that I truly missed.

I’m really pleased to see your analysis here on performance – obviously your tests can’t possibly represent our workload or use-case, but I do feel this adds weight to validating our decision. Thanks for sharing your efforts!
