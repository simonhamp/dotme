### We moved to Spain

We did it! In the middle of a pandemic! We’ve left the London life, the fuzzy-warm community that is Crouch End, the variety and the complexity and the expense of it all behind. All in favour of the genuinely warm Las Palmas, a level up from a 1-bed flat (~70m2) to a 3-bed apartment with a balcony and a communal pool, that’s 15 minutes from the best beach in the Canaries, Las Canteras.
