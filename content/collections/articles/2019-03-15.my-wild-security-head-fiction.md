### My Wild Security Head-Fiction

I‚Äôm not a security expert. I confidently believe I don‚Äôt have the kind of mind it takes to ‚Äòalways expect the worst‚Äô. I couldn‚Äôt be a threat analyst, defence strategist or CIA agent because I think you need a drastic view of the world which says something along the lines of ‚Äòeveryone is a potential threat‚Äô.

That being said, occasionally I do have [thought experiments](https://medium.com/@simonhamp/a-web-app-store-that-makes-the-web-safer-32e79fa640c8#.ai199n5q9) where I allow my mind to wonder/wander over security-related topics occasionally.

Sometimes these are mundane like my realisation that using the same password for everything is a bad idea: what if there were *no* passwords.

Other times it gets a little more Jason Bourne. Like ‚Äúwhat if someone desperately wanted to gain access to my WhatsApp?‚Äù

Granted, *why* anyone would want access to one of my messaging accounts is beyond me. It‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to suggest that anyone would go to these lengths for *me*. But I always find that personalising these thought experiments makes them more worthwhile ‚Äî if any workable solutions came out of it, I‚Äôd probably be the first person to benefit by it. (Dog-fooding. Also the only real thing I was moved by in the film *Joy*.)

Anyway, back to the point. WhatsApp. More specifically, WhatsApp Web. It still has that weird 2-factor auth thing going on; they generate an auto-refreshing QR code to enable login.

This is actually quite cool. I don‚Äôt need a username and password. There‚Äôs no signup flow especially as the service is aimed only at existing users not as a way to on-board new users.

I don‚Äôt need an app I don‚Äôt already have and the whole login process happens quickly and fairly silently between my phone and my computer as if by magic. It‚Äôs actually quite beautiful.

The main benefit of this is that someone can‚Äôt guess my WhatsApp username/password combo and login to my WhatsApp account and see all of my conversation history, blah-de-blah. So it has the feelings of being secure.

Now, I‚Äôm not going to pick apart the other elements involved in making this secure, because that‚Äôs not where my thought experiment led me. Perhaps another time.

For now, I lingered on the possibility that someone would try to gain access to my phone and use it to sign in to WhatsApp Web, for whatever peculiar reason. Maybe they prefer the browser experience, or maybe they have that myopic, maniacal, world-dominating twist on their eyesight which only a Chrome Extension was able to correct.

I use an iPhone 8 currently and ‚Äì like a good safety-conscious individual ‚Äì I have a security code lock. I‚Äôve also set up TouchID.

So what if this imaginary diabolical antagonist (or state actor) wanted access to my iPhone? Well he/she could torture me to try and get my passcode. Or they could restrain me and find which finger to use to unlock my phone. Easy!

(For those unfamiliar with TouchID, you can set it up to use multiple fingers and thumbs to unlock your phone, which is handy.)

But what if you could set one of those to be a dead man‚Äôs switch?

So let‚Äôs say you use your ring finger on your left hand for the complete opposite effect of TouchID; instead of unlocking the device, it actually wipes it. Similar to the setting that can wipe the device after a number of failed passcode attempts.

The beauty of this is that it would actually look like you‚Äôre going to unlock the phone, but then you just hold it there for a few extra seconds and BAM üí• all gone.

Assuming I would be held against my will, with the threat of death looming over a lack of cooperation, I would surely perish. But on the plus side, now I‚Äôm not concerned about someone taking my finger off just to get into my WhatsApp convos.

Just a thought anyway.
