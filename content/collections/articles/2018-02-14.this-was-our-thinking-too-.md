This was our thinking too. As we are *only* building an API, I can’t foresee there’s much that’s missing that we’ll ever wish we had.

The only thing I’ve come across is FormRequests… it would actually be quite nice to have something similar that would enable us to easily embellish the Request object with specific validation rules depending on the endpoint called… but maybe we’ll work something up for this ourselves.

I also found the support for OAuth in Lumen to be a bit lacking. And I don’t mean that Lumen should be an OAuth server, but that it lacks any kind of bindings to help you work with an external OAuth server… unless I’m missing something. So we had to write our own.

Interesting that generators was one of your mentioned issues. I found [this package](https://github.com/flipboxstudio/lumen-generator) which goes some of the way to solving that.
