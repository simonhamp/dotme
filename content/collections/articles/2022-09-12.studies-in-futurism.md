### Studies in Futurism

Schools, colleges and universities may well disappear. Their qualifications will become obsolete. On-the-job training will become a formalised vocational studying platform giving people skills, opportunity and meaningful qualifications.

The current school system lacks the ability to match people’s desires with the skills most in need. Companies have acute needs and cannot rely on a steady stream of new graduates in all fields. Some fields are understaffed because no one ‘qualifies’ even though many try.

Institutions struggle, students struggle and businesses struggle. The new education will of necessity be more like apprenticeships and the role will be there at the end if you get a ‘passing grade.’ Then businesses will once again breed loyalty.

Mix in the growing trend of selfless and transparent C-levellers and the general ethos of companies moving towards flexibility and a more life-first balance and we could be looking at a major revolution in the job market in a few short years.
