Adam, I couldn’t agree more! Making APIs accessible is something that has been tried for a long time. I recall experiments from Microsoft and others with innovative UIs to try to make it easier along with attempts to make end points and function references digestible by software in an automated way (WSDL etc).

There are also services like Blockspring, building on and *in* the tools that business people are using day to day and educating about possibilities by example.

I’m all for people learning to code – I think it’s the new educational milestone – but this wont be felt for another couple of generations. I feel that the current workforce, whilst highly adaptable, will not embrace coding to the level required by most APIs.

We must meet in the middle and it’s as much the responsibility of the API developers to make their systems more accessible. This is the next frontier that will drive new innovation as we all start to build bigger things on the web foundation.
