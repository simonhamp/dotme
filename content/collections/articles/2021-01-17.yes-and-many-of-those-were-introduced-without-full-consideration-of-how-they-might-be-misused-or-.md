Yes and many of those were introduced without full consideration of how they might be misused or abused, by a much smaller group of maintainers and developers.

PHP has matured a lot since then, not just the language itself, but also the processes that go into evolving that language beside the sheer number of developers using it.

In light of that, these additions have been added after far more consideration. Telling folks to outright avoid them isn’t particularly helpful.
