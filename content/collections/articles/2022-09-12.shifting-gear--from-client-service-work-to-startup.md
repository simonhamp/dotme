### Shifting gear: From client service work to startup

3rd February, 2017 was my last day with [isev](https://www.isev.co.uk).

I was extremely fortunate to be working with them. For a small company based in Shropshire (middle England), being successful is hard. Having a great reputation and winning set of clients is harder still, but somehow they continue to manage all three!
