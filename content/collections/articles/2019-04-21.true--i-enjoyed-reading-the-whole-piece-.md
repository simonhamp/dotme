True. I enjoyed reading the whole piece. There are definitely many lessons to draw from it but I felt this one was especially worth calling out as for me this is the crux of it.

So much of management these days is geared to “metrics” and “achievers” are the ones who exhibit a specific set of behaviours around a given set of metrics.

Like all statistics, the vital question isn’t *what* to measure; it’s *why.* ‘Why are we measuring our sales staff performance like this? Does this stat actually help us to identify suitable candidates?’

Sometimes it’s not even measurable. Sometimes you can only see the value that someone was bringing to the team after they leave. It requires managers to be in touch with their reports and not just watching spreadsheets.
