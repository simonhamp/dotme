### 4 Years In

I’ve been at [Elvie](https://www.elvie.com) 4 years already!

I can’t quite believe how quickly the time has gone by or [the](https://www.elvie.com/en-gb/shop/elvie-curve) [amazing](https://www.timeout.com/london/news/giant-inflatable-boobs-have-popped-up-all-over-shoreditch-040119) [things](https://www.elvie.com/en-gb/shop/elvie-pump) we’ve accomplished as a team.

2020 was by far the hardest year, but in many ways the most rewarding and exciting so far because of what it has teed up for 2021.

Like many developers who have a history working for web design agencies or consultancies, I longed to work in product – from an ‘outside’ perspective, the opportunity to continue working on and refining a well-understood code base is such an intriguing and tantalising possibility, it’s hard to keep focus on the day-to-day of client service work.

Perhaps it speaks to some deeper entrepreneurial spirit? I’m not sure. But what I do know is that it was the best move I’ve made and I won’t quickly be going back to client services!

Making that transition into a very early-stage startup and a hardware one that is positioning itself in a notoriously underrepresented space is extremely risky. I’m sure that on more than one occasion we’ve come very close to not making it.

Out of sheer drive and tenacity, we survived and are now thriving! These are the people I get to work with every day. They’re not doing it to please investors or to keep the company going… they’re doing it because **we’re changing women’s lives for the better and improving their experience of what technology can be for them**.

#### What lies ahead

Last year I was promoted to Head of Software Engineering and given the remit to grow the team. There are now 4 of us and we’re looking to at least double that in 2021.

Digital is a huge part of any business and it’s almost impossible these days to be an independent hardware startup that doesn’t also have a sizeable software element, but we’re going one step further this year.

I can’t say more than that right now, but if you’re in the UK and into Laravel, I’d love if you’d [consider joining us](https://apply.workable.com/elvie/j/53E6670F2C/). If you have any questions, I’m more than happy to answer them.
