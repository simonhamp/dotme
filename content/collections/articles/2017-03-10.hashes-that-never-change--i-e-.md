Hashes *that never change* (i.e. based on old, cracked hashing algorithms) may be a time-bomb, but hashing user input (password or not) will always be a thing. Hashing algorithms will always need to be ‘strong enough’ against the tools *du jour*, so I think it’s a bit over-dramatic to consider that hashes in general are a time-bomb.

While password-less entry may sidestep this, it’s sideways move out of one frying pan and into another.
