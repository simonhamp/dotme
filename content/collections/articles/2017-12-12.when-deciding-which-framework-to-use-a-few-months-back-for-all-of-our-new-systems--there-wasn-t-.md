When deciding which framework to use a few months back for all of our new systems, there wasn’t even a mention of framework speed. The truth is in practice that it just doesn’t matter for a large proportion of use-cases and certainly not for ours (funded startup with tens of thousands of users).

If it becomes an issue, you’ll probably be moving away from a framework altogether and you’ll have a very deep knowledge of your needs – so you can build super lean vanilla code. You may even switch platforms and go with a language that gives you way more throughput than PHP.
