I absolutely agree with you there. I just thought this was a neat alternative solution that some people might like :)

It has the added bonus of forcing you to be explicit about the variables you pass to your partials — probably making ‘future you’ and other developers more aware of what’s going on — as well as helping to scope your variables.
