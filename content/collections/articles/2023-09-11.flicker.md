### Flicker

_I originally wrote this 1 year ago today but didn't publish it._

Just a little flicker,  
That’s all it takes.  
Makes smaller and lighter  
Until it’s all erased.


Can’t get close to touch.  
Intense – it’s just too much.  
Life is drawn: out and up  
And away, away, away.


A tiny flicker,  
That’s how it starts.  
My heart’s beating quicker  
As it tears our world apart.


One more lick  
That laps at me;  
It burns my heart,  
I can't break free.


The heat gets thicker,  
The smoke increases.  
The wall of flames  
Envelopes everything.


It's all food that  
Makes the fire tall  
And my tears disappear  
Before they fall.

"When will the last flicker fade?"
