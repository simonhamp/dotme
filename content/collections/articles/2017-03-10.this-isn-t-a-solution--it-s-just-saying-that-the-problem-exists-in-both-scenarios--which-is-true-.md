This isn’t a solution, it’s just saying that the problem exists in both scenarios, which is true. The difference is, with a password reset flow you can at least ask more personally-identifying questions to help in determining if the reset request is genuine, e.g. “what’s your mother’s maiden name?”. Also consider a blind-copy request to a second address with a timer-based, one-click reset and lockdown, stopping further reset requests from the compromised email address.
