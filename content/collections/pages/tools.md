I use a number of tools to get my work done:

- I still use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)! It's crazy fast for chucking a folder at and writing some code
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for when I'm working on more complex apps/projects
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/?via=simon) for working with Git - I'm not afraid of the command line, but a GUI makes Git even more fun to work with
- [ScreenStudio](https://screenstudio.lemonsqueezy.com?aff=ZJVoO) for quick screen recordings
- [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/DRLWQG) - the best privacy-protecting alternative to Google Analytics
