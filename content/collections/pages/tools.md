I use a number of tools to get my work done. I also recommend a lot of these tools to my clients:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) - obvs
- [Statamic](https://statamic.com) - the CMS I used to make this site and what everyone should be using already (built on Laravel ofc)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - yes, I still use it! It's crazy fast for chucking a folder at and writing some code

- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - for when I'm working on more complex apps/projects
- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/?via=simon) - for working with Git - I'm not afraid of the command line, but a GUI makes Git even more fun to work with
- [ScreenStudio](https://screenstudio.lemonsqueezy.com?aff=ZJVoO) - for quick screen recordings
- [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/DRLWQG) - the best privacy-protecting alternative to Google Analytics
- [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/adc0b0656d7c) - good, solid virtual servers
- [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) - how I manage those servers
- [OhDear](https://ohdear.app/?via=simonhamp) - excellent uptime monitoring
- [Mailcoach](https://mailcoach.app/?via=simonhamp) - straightforward email campaigns and transactional email management
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) - a really nice Mac database client
- [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net?ref=44kyjbqcw9) - I mainly use Bunny for DNS only right now
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - where this site is hosted
