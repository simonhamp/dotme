I'm a maker, an imagination-realiser. I turn ideas into code. Beautiful code.

That code does stuff that matters. Like getting data from A to B, selling your product, fighting fraud, shipping your product, integrating your variety of systems (such as your ERP, CRM, CMS and eCommerce), automating your business.

I've done this for countless businesses and startups, but most notably for Elvie, having built the API and other systems to support the entire ecosystem of innovative products (a $9-figure business).

Doing this in a lean way that scales is believed to be the thing that only well-funded startups or large enterprises are capable of.

Don't buy into that hype.

It doesn't cost the earth to reap the benefits of a top-tier digital team, to build a digital strategy and execute on the vision.
