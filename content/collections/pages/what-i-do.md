I'm a maker, an imagination-realiser. I turn ideas into code. **Beautiful code**.

Mostly in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I'm really fond of Tailwind, Vue, Livewire, Alpine.js and Laravel. I can make some great software really quickly with these awesome tools. I'm good at it.

That code does stuff that matters. Like getting data from A to B, selling your product, fighting fraud, shipping goods around the world, integrating multiple systems (such as your ERP, CRM, CMS and eCommerce) into one to **improve your efficiency** and **make your team happy**, automating your business.

I also enjoy working closely with other engineers, **solving problems together**, being **decisive**, and helping them to focus to **stay lean and build rapidly**.

More than just technical knowledge, this comes down to mentoring, finding out what makes someone tick as an individual and as part of a group.

It also involves identifying the splinters and papercuts in their day-to-day and choosing appropriate tools and workflows, _configuring for happiness_ so they can be **more satisfied and productive**.

I've done this for countless businesses and startups, but perhaps most notably for Elvie, having built the API and other systems to support the entire ecosystem of innovative female health products.

Doing this in a lean way that scales is believed to be the thing that only well-funded startups or large enterprises are capable of.

**Don't buy into that hype.**

It doesn't cost the earth to reap the benefits of a top-tier digital team, to build a digital strategy and execute on the vision.
