### <a href="https://laradevs.com" target="_blank">Laradevs</a>

Connecting the best Laravel Developers with the best Laravel Teams.

Originally called Laradir. I acquired the site in Nov 2023.

## Archived

### Spred

Spred was an attempt to use Open Banking to facilitate newer, faster, more secure ways to send and receive money.

### Gold Tamarin

This was a new take on an email platform where the email _recipients_ would get paid. Privacy focused.

This project never made it past the waitlist stage.

The Golden Lion Tamarin is a small and beautiful, but sadly endangered, little monkey. I hope Gold Tamarin lets me sponsor efforts to protect these vibrant creatures.

### Veliance

Veliance was a free to use directory of great Laravel freelancers that I built on Notion. It now directs to Laradevs.

### SeQR

Was a low-cost, no-frills QR code management and analytics tool.

### Ensemble

Ensemble was a way to manage data around your Composer dependencies and get alerted when there were new versions or license changes. It didn't make it as a paid product, but I may revisit this as an open source project in the future.
