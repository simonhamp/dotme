This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/) page.

It's {{ now | format('F Y') }}. I'm married to the wonderful [Noelia](https://noeliasantana.com). We're living in Gran Canaria with our 3-year-old mixed Perro Majorero, Bowie 🐕.

I'm doing lots of things (maybe too many!)

The main thing is I'm back to being a freelance software engineer, which means, predominantly, slinging code in exchange for food, clothing and shelter.

I'm doing that for [Clients](/clients/), as well as a number of [Side Projects](/side-projects/) and [Open Source](/open-source/) work.

Oh, and I'm [blogging](/blog/) a bit more intentionally again and getting back into writing things that aren't just work-/tech-related.
