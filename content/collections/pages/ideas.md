Here's a growing list of things I'd love to work on / interesting problems I want to solve:

- **A hosted version of Statamic**  
  You get a Statamic instance spun up and completely ready to use. You can point your domain at it
  and you get access to the git repo. You can walk away from the service and self-host easily
  
- **A code generation/consumption web service**  
  Think voucher codes. Imagine you could generate codes on-demand with one API call and, with
  another API call validate a code and with a final API call consume that code
  
- **A gimmick ad page**  
  Like million dollar homepage, but instead of $1 per pixel, for a monthly amount, the buyer gets 
  their ad shown there and everywhere that embeds the ad every day, non-stop... until someone else
  pays more
  
- **An inter-website videogame battle**  
  Say you're navigating Hacker News and I'm navigating BBC News... basically have a minigame appear
  where users can battle across sites and the site gets ranked based on the outcome. Minigames could
  be anything quick and generally universal (Connect4, Battleship, Noughts & Crosses etc)
  
- **A bookmarking tool with a twist**  
  I have bookmarks (or favourites/likes/upvotes etc) on a bunch of services - Youtube, Twitter,
  LinkedIn, Hacker News - I want something that brings all of them together into one place and lets
  me filter through them with ease
  
- **A fun git client**  
  Git is a complex but powerful tool, like Excel. Getting more folks to use it well feels valuable
  to the world at large
  
- **Statamic email marketing add-on**
  A Statamic add-on that supports creating, sending and reporting on your email campaigns. Use
  Statamicâ€™s Bard to write rich, compliant emails and Laravel's tooling to communicate with the
  mail sending service of your choice
  
- **Privacy-protecting physical address sharing**
  What if you didn't need to provide your delivery address at all to a vendor? How could it work so
  that your name and address didn't need to appear on the outer packaging in order for you to receive
  a parcel?
  
- **Opt-in demo-based advertising platform**
  Sign up for an account, provide relevant details (age, location, interests, gender), install the
  browser extension and see ads every once in a while. Get paid for each ad you see/watch
