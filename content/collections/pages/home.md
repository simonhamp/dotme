London / Las Palmas-based freelance software engineer. I've been building digital products for businesses of all sizes for almost 20 years. For details on how I do that, read more about [what I do](/what-i-do).

I work with innovative [Clients](/clients), have a few of my own [Side Projects](/side-projects) and sponsor and contribute to various [Open Source](/open-source) projects.

I was Head of Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.elvie.com" target="_blank">Elvie</a>, where I worked for almost 6 years innovating in the #FemTech space.
